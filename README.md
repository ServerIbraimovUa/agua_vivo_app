## About project:

The Agua Vivo App is a mobile app that helps users maintain healthy body hydration levels. The app sends reminders about when and how much water to drink, and tracks how much water you drink per day, week, or month.

### Installation

In order to install Agua Vivo App, you need to go to the official website of the application and download the APK file. After downloading, you need to allow the installation of applications from unknown sources in the settings of your smartphone. Then you need to run the APK file and follow the instructions on the screen.

### Using

After installing the app, you need to open it and enter your details, such as your weight, gender, activity level, and when you usually wake up and go to bed. The app uses this data to calculate the optimal amount of water you should drink each day.

The app will send you reminders that you need to drink a glass of water at certain time intervals. You can adjust the frequency and sound of reminders in the application settings. Every time you drink water, you have to tap the Drink button on the app for it to count towards your daily amount.

The app also shows you statistics on how much water you drank in a day, week or month. You can view this information as graphs or tables. The app also gives you tips and facts about water and its health benefits.
